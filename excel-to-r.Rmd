## I Can't Do This!

```{r, img-mountain1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="photo by [Toomas Tartes](https://unsplash.com/@toomastartes) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/Yizrl9N_eDA)"}

```

Getting started with R can feel like standing in front of a mountain with no idea how you could possibly climb it, especially if you're new to programming. 

> I couldn’t get R to do anything. It wouldn’t read in files, draw a plot or multiply two numbers together. All I could do was generate mystifying errors and get mocked on Stack Overflow for asking redundant questions. This was all made more frustrating by the fact that I could accomplish all of these things in Excel without much difficulty.

*[Gordon Shotwell's blog post: Excel to R](https://blog.shotwell.ca/posts/r_for_excel_users/)*

The last sentence of that quote embodies how I felt during the first year or two of trying to teach myself R. If you decide to embarck on the journey of learning R, try keeping the mountain metaphor in mind, and remember to occasionally stop looking *up* the mountain and instead look *back* at how far you've come.

```{r, img-mountain2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="photo by [Peter Conlan](https://unsplash.com/@peterconlan) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/LEgwEaBVGMo)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/peter-conlan-LEgwEaBVGMo-unsplash.jpg")
```

Let's get started!

## Getting Started

For this workshop, you won't need to install any software on your own machine; everything will be provided for you here in this document. If you are interested in using the full code from today's workshop on your own machine, a copy is available here, on GitHub.

First things first, we need to download two pieces of software: R and RStudio. We discussed these during the presentation, but here are the links to download each.

### Download Links

#### [R](https://cran.r-project.org)

#### [RStudio](https://rstudio.com)

### First Steps

1. Install R
2. Install RStudio
3. Open RStudio
4. Navigate to the **Tools** menu, **Global Options**
5. Change "Save workspace to .RData on exit:" to *Never*
6. Click [OK]

```{r set-options, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="RStudio Options"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rstudio-options.png")
```

Finally, make sure you have a new script window open in the top right. If you don't, you can navigate to **File** > **New File** > **R Script**.

### Installing Packages

Now that we have R and RStudio installed, we're going to install a set of packages that will make our work a little more straightforward. The packages are part of what is called the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org).

> The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.

To install packages, we use the `install.packages("package_name")` format. Don't forget the quotation marks around the name of the package!

```{r install-packages, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Install "tidyverse" packages
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Once the packages are installed, we need to tell R that you want to use them.

# Load tidyverse packages
library(tidyverse)
```

The reason we didn't need quotation marks around `tidyverse` the second time is because, in this case, RStudio can already see that a package called tidyverse exists in its library. 

### Conventions to Know

| R        	| Description                              	| Shortcut         	|
|----------	|------------------------------------------	|------------------	|
| #        	| Comment out a line                       	|                 	|
| <-       	| The assignment operator                  	| Alt + -          	|
| %>%      	| The pipe function                        	| Ctrl + Shift + M 	|
| $        	| Pick a specific column from a data set   	|                  	|
| ==       	| Comparison operator (x equals y)         	|                 	|
| !=       	| Comparison operator (x does not equal y) 	|                 	|
| is.na()  	| Blank cells                              	|                  	|
| !is.na() 	| Not blank cells                          	|                  	|

### Read the Data

We're now going to read in our data set. To do that, we're going to use the `read_csv` function that comes as part of the `readr` package in the `tidyverse`. Let's break down the function:

- `df`    This is how we'll refer to our data in R. df stands for data frame, but you could use "x", "prospecting", "pumpernickel", or soomething else. My only caution is to avoid naming it the same as another R function (RStudio's autocomplete will help you avoid this.)
- `<-`    This is the assignment operator in R. It says, "Take everything to the right of me and assign it to the object we named in the previous step.
- `read_csv()`    A function of the `readr` package that reads in .csv files. Another package, `readxl`, will let you read in .xlsx files. All of the information within the parenthases tells R about the data we're reading in. In this case, which columns are numbers, and which is a date.

```{r load-data, eval=FALSE}
df <- read_csv(
  "excel-to-r.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    `most recent gift amount` = col_number(),
    `most recent gift date` = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%y"),
    `lifetime giving` = col_number()
  )
)
```

One of the things you're probably starting to realize is that `R` requires you to type *everything*. There aren't any buttons that generate charts or format your columns. This is part of your journey up the mountain. It may be new, it may be weird, and it may be uncomfortable, but keep going and eventually you may not ever want to go back to Excel. 

We're going to use a function from the `janitor` package to reformat out column names with underscores instead of spaces. The reason we're doing that is it makes it much easier for R to know that "most recent gift amount" is not four separate things, but a single variable: most_recent_gift_amount. 

```{r img-janitor, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/janitor_clean_names.png")
```

```{r df-janitor, eval=FALSE}
df <- janitor::clean_names(df)
```

This is a style that I like to use, but there are many others!

```{r img-naming, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/coding_cases.png")
```

## Examining the Data

There are a number of ways to take a look at your data at this point. The first is to click on the name of the data set in the Environment tab. Here are two other ways from within the code.

```{r examine-data, exercise = TRUE}
# Structure: this is a built-in function of R
str(df)

# Glimpse: a more compact version of str that comes with the tidyverse
glimpse(df)
```

## The `dplyr` Package

```{r img-dplyr, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr_wrangling.png")
```

The [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) package provides a "consistent set of verbs that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges."

- `mutate()` adds new variables that are functions of existing  variables
- `select()` picks variables based on their names
- `filter()` picks cases based on their values
- `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary
- `arrange()` changes the ordering of the rows.

`dplyr` has been my workhorse package for almost all of the work that I used to do in Excel, at least in terms of data manipulation.  We'll start with `filter()`.

## Filtering Data

```{r img-filter, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr_filter.jpg")
```

We're approaching this session from the perspective of doing prospecting in Excel. We've started with a data set from our CRM and we're going to append some additional data, create some new columns, and filter the data to create a list of potential prospects for our gift officer.

Let's jump right in to seeing some results. In [Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/filter-data-in-a-range-or-table-01832226-31b5-4568-8806-38c37dcc180e), filtering data is a quick way to sift through the data to find new prospects. 

- Who recently made a gift? 
- Who is rated at a certain threshold?
- Who lives in the city I'm visiting? 

However, one of the challenges in using Excel for this work is that it isn't reproducible. Let's say you apply a series of filters to answer all three of these questions, but then clear the selection when another idea strikes. Do you remember the sequence of filters you applied to get back there? 

What if your fundraiser comes to you and asks, "Why was this prospect added to my portfolio?" Can you answer them?

We're going to start by chaining some pieces together using the `%>%` command. In tidyverse parlance, this is referred to as a "pipe," and it is used to pipe or chain actions together.

```{r example-filter-1, exercise = TRUE}
df %>%
  filter(most_recent_gift_date >= "2019-06-01")
```

Here we took our data **(df)** and piped it **(%>%)** to our filter where we asked it to return prospects whose most recent gift date was greater than or equal to the start of our fiscal year, June 1, 2019 **(filter(most_recent_gift_date >= "2019-06-01"))**.

We can also filter more than one thing at a time:

```{r example-filter-2, exercise = TRUE}
df %>%
  filter(most_recent_gift_date >= "2019-06-01",
         st == "TX")
```

In this example, we've added a 2nd filter - **state equals Texas** - to our last example.

## Working with Ratings

Let's start by looking at our ratings. What values do we have in this data set? The "unique" function returns all of the different values within the specific field(s). In this case, we've put df$rating inside the parenthases. That tells R that we want the unique values of the rating column inside the df data set.

```{r example-unique, exercise = TRUE}
unique(df$rating)
```

In the console, you can see the list of ratings there. Let's look at who our $10M+ rated folks are. Here's where we really start diving into R and the tidyverse. The first thing we're going to do is call "df" to tell R that where we're starting. Next, we'll put in this weird symbol "%>%" called a pipe. The pipe is part of the tidyverse and connects pieces of code like a workflow. On the next line we see `filter(rating == "$10M+)`. Altogether, you could read this as:

1. Take the df data frame
2. Then pipe or send it to the filter command
3. Where we want to find ratings that equal (note: ==) $10M+
4. Display the results in the console

```{r example-filter-3, exercise = TRUE}
df %>% 
  filter(rating == "$10M+")
```

If only our real data sets could get us 24,709 prospects rated that highly!

While that's certainly useful, wouldn't it be easier if we could enter a numerical value for rating instead of writing out the actual rating each time? This would be especially helpful if you want a range of ratings.

### VLOOKUP (Excel) vs. Join (R)

Let's append numerical rating values by creating a reference table and recreating the VLOOKUP functionality that you know from Excel. We're going to use a tibble for this functionality. A tibble is simply the name for a tidyverse-styled data set.

The structure of a tibble is:   tibble(column_1_name = c(val1, val2, etc.),
                                       column_2_name = c(val1, val2, etc.),
                                       column_3_name = c(val1, val2, etc.))

We're first going to create a lookup table of values to append to `df`. This is similar to how you might use a 2nd Excel worksheet for your vlookup. Here we use the assignment operator `<-` to assign our tibble the name `rating_values`.

```{r rating-tibble, exercise = TRUE}
rating_values <- tibble(rating = c("Less than $10K",
                                   "$10K-$24K",
                                   "$25K-$49K",
                                   "$50K-$99K",
                                   "$100K-$249K",
                                   "$250K-$999K",
                                   "$1M-$2.49M",
                                   "$2.5M-$4.99M",
                                   "$5M-$9.99M",
                                   "$10M+"),
                        rating_value = c(1,
                                         10000,
                                         25000,
                                         50000,
                                         100000,
                                         250000,
                                         1000000,
                                         2500000,
                                         5000000,
                                         10000000))

# Print results
rating_values
```

You'll notice that rating_value is in scientific notation. Here's how to turn that off.

```{r rating-tibble-2, exercise = TRUE}
options(scipen = 50)  # any significantly high number will work, I always use 50

# Print results again
rating_values
```

That's much better. You may have noticed I used the same variable name `rating` on this new data set as we have in `df`. That was intentional. When joining two data sets together, having identical column names makes matching much easier. 

```{r left-join, exercise = TRUE}
# Join together df & rating_values
prospecting <- left_join(df, rating_values)

# If you have lookup column names that don't match:
# prospecting <- left_join(df, rating_values, by = c("df_id_column" = "rating_values_id_column"))

# Look at the newly merged data
prospecting
```

## Creating New Variables

We'll use the `mutate()` function to take our new rating values and create a new variable "rating_bucket" that groups our ratings into Leadership Gift (LG), Major Gift (MG), and Principal Gift (PG) ratings. We'll combine the `mutate` command with an `if_else` statement just like you can do in Excel.

The format of mutate is: `mutate(df, new_variable = transformation(existing_variable))`.

```{r example-mutate, exercise = TRUE}
prospecting <- prospecting %>%
  mutate(rating_bucket = if_else(
    rating_value >= 1000000,
    "PG",
    if_else(rating_value >= 100000, "MG", "LG")
  ))

# Look at our three rating columns
prospecting %>% 
  select.list(rating,
              rating_value,
              rating_bucket)
```

What that code did was look at the rating value column that we joined in in the last command and, if it was greater than 1,000,000, make the value in the new rating_bucket column "PG" for principal gift. If the value didn't match that criteria, it moves down to the 100,000 level and assigns anything that is  greater than or equal to 100,000  to the "MG" bucket, and everything else is given the "LG" bucket.

## Rearranging Columns

## Prospecting with R

Now that we have our data set up, let's start doing some prospecting. We'll start small and build up our complexity as we go. Hopefully this sparks some ideas about how you can use this in your own work.

### Combining `count()` and `filter` to count numbers of prospects

```{r prospecting-1, exercise = TRUE}
# How many prospects do we have by rating?
prospecting %>% 
  count(rating_bucket)

# How many prospects are there in Texas?
prospecting %>% 
  filter(st == "TX") %>% 
  count(rating_bucket)

# How many prospects are rated at least at the major gift level, live in Texas,
# and have lifetime giving of at least $10,000?
prospecting %>% 
  filter(rating_value >= 100000,
         st == "TX",
         lifetime_giving >= 10000) %>% 
  count()

# How many prospects are rated at least at the major gift level, live in Texas,
# have lifetime giving of at least $10,000, and are alumni?
pool <- prospecting %>% 
  filter(rating_value >= 100000) %>% 
  filter(st %in% c("TX", "CA")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(school)) %>% 
  filter(lifetime_giving >= 10000) %>% 
  # filter(school == "Engineering") %>% 
  {.}
```

Did you notice those last few lines?

```{r code-focus, eval=FALSE}
  filter(lifetime_giving >= 10000) %>% 
  # filter(school == "Engineering") %>% 
  {.}
```

## Data Visualization

```{r}
library(scales)  # allows me to format numbers as currency

prospecting %>% 
  filter(!is.na(school)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(school, lifetime_giving)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(title = "How much have our alumni given over their lifetimes?",
       x = "School",
       y = "Lifetime Giving",
       fill = "") +
  theme_minimal()

prospecting %>% 
  filter(!is.na(school)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(school, lifetime_giving)) +
  # geom_point(color = "steelblue") +
  geom_jitter(color = "steelblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  labs(title = "How much have our alumni given over their lifetimes?",
       x = "School",
       y = "Lifetime Giving",
       fill = "") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Exporting Data

```{r export, eval=FALSE}
write_csv(prospecting, "filepath.csv")
```
